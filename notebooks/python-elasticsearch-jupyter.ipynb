With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.</td>\n",

The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out.

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga.

       "      <td>Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.</td>\n",

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is the moment that a crew of firefighters struggled to haul a giant  pig out of a garden swimming pool. The prize porker, known  as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble . 'The crew rescued the pig from the swimming pool using specialist animal rescue slide boards, strops and lines to haul the pig from the swimming pool.' But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land. A fire brigade spokesman said that she appeared none the worse for her impromptu swim after stepping over the edge of the domestic pool.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.</td>\n",

Co-star John Stamos announced Monday night on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" that Netflix has ordered up a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called \"Fuller House.\" The show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J. Tanner in the original series -- which aired from 1987 to 1995 -- as the recently widowed mother of three boys. \"It's sort of a role reversal, and we turn the house over to her,\" Stamos told Kimmel. Jodie Sweetin, who played Stephanie Tanner in the original series, and Andrea Barber, who portrayed D.J.'s best friend Kimmy Gibbler, will both return for the new series, Netflix said. Stamos will produce and guest star. Talks with co-starsBob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are ongoing, Netflix said. The show will be available next year, Netflix said. \"As big fans of the original Full House, we are thrilled to be able to introduce Fuller House's new narrative to existing fans worldwide, who grew up on the original, as well as a new generation of global viewers that have grown up with the Tanners in syndication,\"  Netflix Vice President of Original Content Cindy Holland said in a statement. The show starts with Tanner -- now named Tanner-Fuller (get it ... Fuller?) -- pregnant, recently widowed and living in San Francisco. Her younger sister Stephanie -- now an aspiring musician -- and her lifelong best friend and fellow single mom, Kimmy, move in to help her care for her two boys and the new baby.

       "      <td>At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people \"slags\" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively. Zsolt Szalontai, 18, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of rape. He was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute.</td>\n",

Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.'

       "      <td>Teenage girls do better in single sex schools as they can focus on their work rather than impressing boys, a leading headmistress says. Rhiannon Wilkinson, head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire reportedly said that a 'boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by the opposite sex, who are known to mature slower. She also suggested that single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the 'highly sexualised world' and allow them to 'remain girls for longer.' 'My wide educational experience in both mixed and girls' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment,' she said according to the Telegraph. Rhiannon Wilkinson, the head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, pictured, claims a 'boy free' environment allows teenage girls to focus on their work . She added: 'In co-ed environments lots of girls when adolescence kicks want to be liked by boys not just for their intelligence and want to be popular with boys. But she said in all girl environments pupils are 'free from that,' according to the Telegraph. Two years ago Scientists at Newcastle University found that girls really do mature faster than boys. They discovered that as the brain matures it begins to 'prune' information that is stored and focus on what is important. Tony Little, head at Eton College, has previously said that single sex schools allow children to retain their 'innocence' For girls this can happen as early as 10 years old, but for boys it can take until between 15 and 20 for the same. Tony Little, the head of Eton College, has also spoken of the benefits of single sex schools. He said they allow children to retain their 'innocence' and be 'themselves' for longer. 'What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC. Boys could also benefit from being taught separately. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. Mr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability. 'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.'</td>\n",

The baby-faced boy from Memphis, Tennessee, poses with guns, cash, and bags of what looks like marijuana. Scroll down for video . Baby-faced: This little boy has amassed more than 3,000 followers on Twitter with pictures like these . In many pictures he is smoking suspicious substances, with captions such as 'High Life' Backlash: The boy, from Memphis, has prompted a wave of critics calling his stunts 'sad' In one video he laughs and points the gun at the camera in an apparent attempt to look menacing - as adults laugh in the background. In others, he is pictured blowing smoke, with the caption: 'High Life'. Tweets include the phrases, 'I need a bad b****', 'f*** da police', and 'gang sh** n****'. Some feature sexual references, such as: 'quit suckin my d***'. As he is a minor, DailyMail.com will not identify the little boy. The child's tweets have prompted backlash from other Twitter users and members of the community. One woman tweeted him: 'you need help i feel so bad for you your parents should be ashamed please get help and a education this is sad and disappointing.' Another Twitter user said: 'You poor baby. Just stop it &amp; go to school.' Adults around: Many of his pictures and videos are taken with adults who are seen laughing, unfazed . Guns: The little boy, who appears to be barely teenage, regularly poses for his followers with guns . The boy hit back at his critics claiming he has had a tough year and the backlash is 'stressing out' his mother . Orrden Williams, a Memphis resident who has been the victim of gang violence, told AOL.com: 'What he's doing on here is something that he's going to bring upon society one day. It's just inevitable.' He added: 'All it takes is the right influence, and all this can change. So that's a wake-up Memphis call right there.' Hitting back at critics, the boy tweeted on Friday: 'Wish some people would mind dey own business' as 'it's stressing my mama out'. He adds that his sister has 'been locked up for two years' and his critics 'don't know the half of what we been through end of 2014 &amp; beg of 2015.' Authorities are increasingly cognizant of Twitter as a means of perpetuating gang culture.

'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them, El Pais reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke. The boy, only identified by his initials M.P.C., had also said it would be easy to carry out an attack in the school with 'good weapons.' Judicial staff members take out the body of a teacher allegedly killed by a student armed with a crossbow at the Instituto Joan Foster  in Barcelona, Spain . Horror: Emergency Service members accompany two women out of the Joan Fuster Institue in Barcelona as it emerged that the teenage attacker had a 'kill list' A visibly distressed man, believed to be a member of staff, is helped out of the school . Aftermath: Students and parents leave the Joan Fuster Institute in a bus in Barcelona while police hold the suspect in the school . Following his detention after the slaughter, the boy was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination, said Jose Miguel Company, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. 'He was very disturbed and saying strange and incoherent things,' said Company, who added that the examination is aimed at determining whether the boy has psychiatric problems or whether he was faking them. The knife and crossbow used in the attack are believed to belong to the boy's father, who is reported to have kept a collection of weapons at home. His sister, also a pupil at the school, is reported to have fainted when she discovered what had happened. A friend of the sister of the alleged killer, who has not been named, said: 'She is a lovely person but he did strange things.' The female teacher attacked only suffered superficial wounds and her daughter is being treated in hospital with minor injuries. Another victim, a 14-year-old boy, was stabbed in the chest, but is now in stable condition in hospital, El Pais reports. Barcelona police said the boy has been arrested but would not confirm the weapon used in the attack. The attack took place in the Sant Andreu neighborhood of the city just after 9am, and the boy was detained shortly afterwards. The regional Mosses d'Esquadra police force are understood to be holding him at his school this morning on the orders of a judge so he could be examined by experts. Attack: The 13-year-old boy reportedly burst into the school armed with a knife and crossbow, killing a male teacher and injuring four others . Shocking: The attack took place just after 9am this morning and police confirmed the boy has been detained . Although he was earlier reported to have fired an arrow at the injured female teacher, sources later said he used the tip of the crossbow to stab her in the head and a leg. The school caretaker is understood to have wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him. Mossos d'Esquadra said in a statement: 'We have identified a minor on suspicion of the death of a teacher at a school in Barcelona. 'The incident happened inside the school about 9.15am when the minor allegedly attacked the teacher with a sharp object. 'During the incident four people were slightly injured, two female teachers and two pupils. 'Three of them have been transferred to hospital and one of them, a female teacher, was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.' The attack took place on the 16th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre when seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and one teacher. The 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado, is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. A spokesman for regional police said it was too early to determine whether Monday's attack was an attempt to copy the Columbine attack.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A gun-wielding mother has been arrested after allegedly firing into a crowd of people outside an apartment complex in a bid to break up a fight - only for the bullet to hit and kill her teenage son. Latoya Tilson, 33, took out a .25-caliber handgun and fired several times into the feuding crowd in College Park, Georgia, on Saturday night after she was hit in the face by someone, police said. But while one bullet struck a 17-year-old boy in the buttocks, another hit Tilson's 15-year-old son, Pierre, in the head. Pierre had apparently been trying to protect his  sister, 13, from the other boy. When first responders arrived at the scene, the teenager was lying unconscious on the floor. He was not breathing and a bullet was lodged in his head. His mother had fled the scene, it is alleged. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Mother Latoya Tilson (pictured), 33, has been arrested after allegedly firing into a crowd of people outside an apartment complex in a bid to break up a fight - only for the bullet to hit and kill her teenage son . Victim: Tilson fired several times into the feuding crowd in College Park, Georgia, on Saturday night after she was hit in the face by someone, police said. One of the shots killed her 17-year-old son, Pierre (pictured) Pierre was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday. On Saturday night, Tilson was arrested on several charges, including aggravated assault and cruelty to children, after shocked witnesses told police she had seemingly accidentally shot her son. She is now expected to face upgraded charges following Pierre's death. The other shooting victim, who has not been named, is believed to have been successfully treated in hospital for his injury. During the incident outside the Godby Road apartment complex, where Tilson lived, Pierre was allegedly trying to protect his younger sister from the other boy when the situation escalated. 'The mother went out there allegedly to break it up,' Master Sergeant Jeff Hightower told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday, adding: 'During the altercation, someone hit her in the face.' Tilson then reportedly took out her small-caliber handgun and fired several shots into the crowd, accidentally striking Pierre, a freshman at Southwest DeKalb High School and a keen drummer. Scene: When first responders arrived at the scene, Pierre was lying unconscious on the floor. He was not breathing and a bullet was lodged in his head. His mother had fled, it is alleged. Above, police at the scene . Shooting\" The teenager was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday afternoon . First responders arrived at the scene in the 3100 block of Godby Road at around 8pm. They performed chest compressions on Pierre until EMS arrived and transported him to hospital. Speaking to WSB-TV before Pierre's death at 1.30pm on Monday, the victim's father, Wayne Jones, said he forgave Tilson for 'accidentally' shooting their son, adding that she was on suicide watch. 'She's very distraught at this point,' Jones said. 'If she's looking or listening, I forgive you.' Pierre and his sister reportedly lived with their father, but had been visiting their mother for the Easter weekend. Neighbors who heard the gunshots were shocked to hear Tilson had allegedly shot and killed her son, with many believing the mother should have reacted to the fight differently. One neighbor, Leslie Brooks, said: 'I just think its really sad. I just think there's another way that the situation could have been handled. Maybe the police could have been called a little sooner. 'It shocked the whole community. Because there are a lot of children out. There are a lot of parents. 'I'm a mother, so I can only imagine the devastation that she is feeling as well.' She added: 'But to pull out a gun, as a mother into a children's situation, I just think it's really sad.' Another, Stacey Marshall, who was at South Hampton Estates when the dispute broke out, told 11Alive: 'It wasn't on purpose at all. It was a mother trying to protect her kids, it just went wrong.' 'It shocked the whole community': Neighbors who heard the gunshots were shocked to hear Tilson had allegedly shot and killed her son.

They performed chest compressions on Pierre until EMS arrived and transported the teen to hospital . Southwest DeKalb High School band director, James Seda, who taught Pierre, said he was heartbroken when he heard the news of the shooting - and drove to the hospital to visit the teen. He reportedly played one of the victim's drum solos in a bid to get him to respond, but to no avail. Tilson also faces charges of family violence, reckless conduct and the use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, CBS reported. And she will likely face a number of upgraded charges. She waived her first court appearance on Monday. Her next hearing will take place on April 20. Fulton County District’s Attorney Office is dealing with the case. An investigation is ongoing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The naked bodies of a young couple were found stuffed in boxes in India after becoming victims of a suspected honour killing. Locals discovered the dead pair, believed to be in their mid to late 20s, in separate metal trunks in a public park in Haryana state, around 30 miles south of New Delhi. Police said the man's legs had been chopped off and put inside the trunk, while his partner was found wearing a set of glass bangles traditionally worn by newlywed women. Macabre: The naked bodies of a young couple are found stuffed in boxes in a northern Indian state, the suspected victims of an honour killing . 'It appears they were strangulated and dumped here later. They are yet to be identified,' the chief investigating officer, Praveen Kumar, told AFP. 'It seems like a case of honour killing because the woman is wearing wedding bangles but we are not ruling out other motives,' he added. India has witnessed honour killings - where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships - for centuries, especially in rural areas. They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system. The latest incident comes two days after Haryana police arrested a man and his son for killing his teenage daughter over an inter-caste relationship with a boy. In 2013, a man was beheaded and his wife was killed by her own family for eloping within the same clan. Locals discovered the dead pair, believed to be in their mid to late 20s, in separate metal trunks in a public park in Haryana state, around 30 miles south of New Delhi .</td>\n",

       "      <td>In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces . Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different . Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA . One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments . Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests . Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.' Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.' Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment . One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited . If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write . Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.' Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter . Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests . Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag . Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. Lustybustyliz writes: 'Girl meets boy at the library. He's smart, cute &amp; interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'</td>\n",

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested 80 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing £90 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.</td>\n",

And fans could have the chance to experience Katniss' life as soon as next year, with the attraction expected to open in October 2016. But those looking to wield their bows and act as tribute will have to travel to Dubai for the chance to emulate the mockingjay. Hopefully the Dubai theme park will have safety measures in place for guests - unlike Katniss' experience in the arena in Hunger Games . The four million square foot Motiongate Dubai is set to attract over three million tourists annually, who will be immersed in a cinematic journey through their favourite movies via 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions. Contrasting with the dramatic and nail-biting theme of the Hunger Games is the incorporation of a live stage show based on Step Up: All In and Step Up: Revolution, the two most recent films in Liongate's worldwide franchise. So far there have been three 'Hunger Games' films released, featuring Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, grossing $2.3 billion at box offices worldwide. The final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, is debuting on Nov 20, 2015, and the theme park attractions will be open for fans less than a year later. Dubai Parks and Resorts Chief Executive Officer, Raed Al Nuaimi, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with a Hollywood studio whose creative resources, spirit of innovation and vision of the entertainment experience are so closely aligned with our own. 'Lionsgate's Hunger Games, Step Up and other signature properties are the perfect centerpiece for one of the most visionary new theme parks in the world. 'Through this partnership we are offering even more for the whole family to enjoy on their visit and are confident that Motiongate Dubai will set a global benchmark as the ultimate movie themed destination.' The theme park is set to open for Hunger Games fans in October 2016, and will include 27 different latest-in-technology rides and attractions . The last movie in the Hunger Games franchise is set to be released in the US in November this year . Lionsgate has partnered with Dubai Parks and Resorts to bring a Lionsgate zone to motiongate™ Dubai, the Hollywood-themed park opening in Dubai in October 2016 . 'Motiongate Dubai is poised to become one of the most exciting new entertainment destinations in the world, and we're thrilled that many of our biggest franchises will be an integral part of it,' said Lionsgate Executive Vice President of Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships, Kerry Phelan, and Senior Vice President of Branded Attractions, Jenefer Brown. 'The Lionsgate section of Motiongate Dubai is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to extend the longevity, broaden the global fan base and enrich the vitality of our most exciting entertainment properties.' If the Hunger Games and Step Up attractions were not enough to draw the crowds, Dubai Parks and Resorts even have plans for Legoland Dubai, the first of its kind in the Middle East. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, Orlando, proved that if done correctly, theme parks can tap into a large movie fan base . Fans at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter can walk through a replica Hogwarts Castle, and enjoy three rollercoaster rides . Lionsgate were no doubt spurred on by the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened at Universal Studios, Florida in 2010. Attracting millions of fans from all over the globe, the attraction, which included Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade Village, was a rounding success. Universal opened an extension to the Harry Potter experience, Diagon Alley, last summer which cost an estimated £239million.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces . Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different . Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA . One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments . Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests . Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.' Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.' Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment . One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited . If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write . Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.' Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter . Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests . Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag . Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. Lustybustyliz writes: 'Girl meets boy at the library. He's smart, cute &amp; interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'</td>\n",

       "      <td>When complete strangers Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, discovered they looked so alike that they could be identical twins earlier this week, they made headlines around the world. But the Irish pair aren't the only unrelated twosome to boast real life doppelgängers - and the celebrity world is no exception. Whether actresses Liz Hurley, 49, and Jacqueline Bissett, 70, or model David Gandy, 35, and soap star Dean Gaffney, 37, there's no shortage of Hollywood lookalikes. Among the more unlikely pairings is Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson, 22, who stunned film fans when he stepped out at a première in Spain this week bearing a striking resemblance to James Alexandrou, 30, an actor best known for his role as Martin Fowler in Eastenders. Scroll down for video . Oi, Pat! Martin's in the Hunger Games! Josh Hutcherson arrives at a première in Madrid looking remarkably like Walford's Martin Fowler . Clones: Would Martin Fowler, played by James Alexandrou until 2007, have made it as far in the Hunger Games as Hutcherson's Peeta? Blonde ambition: Prince Harry's ex-girfriend, 29-year-old Chelsy Davy, looks very much like soap queen Letitia Dean, 47 . Strikingly similar: John Meyer, pictured left, and Johnny Depp, right, both have sharp cheekbones, dark hair and a penchant for hipster specs . East end girls: N-Dubz singer and former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, 26, looks incredibly similar to Eastenders' Shona McGarty, 23 . Looking a long way from Panem, Hutcherson's chubbier cheeks, darker hair and stubbled chin gave him a distinctly Walford-worthy appearance, which was only emphasised when the night concluded with the 22-year-old having what looked like a heated argument with girlfriend Claudia Traisac. But the Hutcherson-Alexandrou pairing isn't the only set of twins to emerge from Eastenders, which produces a remarkable number of stars who bear a striking resemblance to Tinseltown's finest. Other unlikely double acts include TV hard man Ross Kemp, 50, who played Grant Mitchell in the long-running soap and who, with his stern expression and shaved head, looks strikingly similar to Hollywood hard man Bruce Willis, 60. Glamorous blonde Gillian Taylforth, 59, is another former Eastenders star with an A-list doppelgänger, in her case supermodel and fellow Londoner, Kate Moss, 41. Another is Letitia Dean, 47, who bears a sisterly resemblance to Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, 29, and Linda Henry, 52, who memorably played Shirley Carter and looks strikingly similar to Heather Mills, 47. Away from Albert Square, there's no shortage of celebrity clones with Johnny Depp, 50, looking remarkably like singer John Mayer, 37, and Zoe Saldana, 36, who looks very much like fellow actress, Jada Pinkett-Smith, 43. Seeing double: 35-year-old Essex-born model David Gandy looks strikingly similar to former Eastenders man, Dean Gaffney, 37 . Similar: Their mutual love of eye make-up makes the similarity between actress Jessie Wallace and  Kris Jenner even more striking . London's finest: One is a blonde with striking high cheekbones and the other is Kate Moss - Gillian Taylforth and her model lookalike . A tale of two hard men: Bruce Willis and Ross Kemp are both famous for playing tough guys - and they look similar as well . The eyes have it! With their short blonde crops and almond-shaped eyes, Eastenders' Linda Henry and skier Heather Mills look very alike . Royal replica: Liz Hurley (left), who is currently starring in cut-price drama The Royals, looks very much like a young Jacqueline Bisset (right) Transatlantic twins: Actor Logan Marshall-Green, 38, best known for his role in The O.C, looks very much like British star Tom Hardy, 37 . Glamorous girls: Will Smith's elegant actress wife Jada Pinkett-Smith, 43, looks remarkably similar to 36-year-old Star Trek star Zoe Saldana . They could be sisters: Australian actress Margot Robbie, 24, is a dead ringer for My Name Is Earl star Jaime Pressly, 37 . Seriously similar: Spanish star Javier Bardem, 46, has an American lookalike in the shape of Grey's Anatomy actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, 48 . Glamorous redheads: Emma Stone, 26, looks like a much younger version of 45-year-old soap actress Melinda Clarke .</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Universal's \"Furious 7\" continues to build momentum at the Friday box office for a weekend debut in the $135 million-$138 million range, the largest opening in North America since fall 2013. That includes a projected Friday take of $58 million-$60 million. The final film featuring the late Paul Walker, \"Furious 7\" is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record-breaking $60 million internationally on Wednesday and Thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $300 million by the end of Easter Sunday. \"Furious 7\" is getting the widest release in Universal's history. Domestically, it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by Good Friday. Internationally, it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories, although it won't open in China, Japan and Russia until later. The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. \"Furious 7\" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And it will easily beat the $121.9 million launch of \"The Hunger Games Mockingjay — Part 1\" in November 2104, making it the largest three-day opening since \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film, \"Fast &amp; Furious 6,\" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open \"Furious 7\" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. \"Furious 7\" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. Dwayne Johnson also reprises his role as Hobbs. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.</td>\n",

In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, scores of downtrodden Syrians wait in line for hours for food in the terror group's self-declared capital Raqqa. It's a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity its jihadi PR machine would like the world to believe. The pictures were posted on Twitter by a member of the anti-ISIS campaign group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives every day by documenting atrocities from inside the city. Scroll down for video . Impoverished: Dozens of Syrians queue for food in the Islamic State's self-declared capital of Raqqa . Downtrodden: In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, the pictures are a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity that terror group's slick PR machine would like the world see . Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness.' For those lucky enough to have a home, he paints a bleak picture of life spent in the dark and cold for hours on end. 'The city suffers from a shortage of electricity where the power goes off for 21 hours in the day,' he wrote in another tweet. ISIS prides itself on its well-oiled propaganda offensive, pumping out images, videos and even a weekly English-language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists. Co-ordinated by its AlHayat Media Centre, the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys. But as seen here, that ease of disseminating information can easily backfire. Most of the Syrians in this line appear to be woman and children. The pictures were posted on Twitter by the anti-ISIS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives leaking information from the city . The food queue pictures emerged days after ISIS took their draconian rule to bizarre new levels by threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans in an apparent crackdown on hipsters. The terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught with music on their mobiles, smoking or turning up late for prayer in the city. Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course'. At the end of their prison term, they will be forced to take a test, with those who pass being released immediately. Those who don't will be fined and kept in prison until they do. Other sickening sentences involve people being stoned to death for alleged adultery and thrown off buildings after being accused of being homosexual. Bleak picture: Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness' One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people.  Freedom of expression has become a crime.' In a separate development, ISIS has announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The country’s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year. The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as ‘shocking’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were ‘unverified’, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow . Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘political football’. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday’s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: ‘Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.’ The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. ‘David Cameron’s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. ‘Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts – even for those who paid in all their working lives – are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.’ Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: ‘It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.’ The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust’s figures were ‘unverified’. He added: ‘We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory – whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. ‘The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work – and we’ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' ‘It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.’ The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: ‘We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon – whereas food poverty is not. ‘As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. ‘The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. ‘It is high time the OFB model of food bank – which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty – is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.’</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, on Saturday to death by hanging, along with 13 members of his group. The sentences will be appealed. The criminal court sentenced 36 other defendants to life in prison on charges of plotting terrorist attacks against state facilities. They faced charges that include \"funding the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in\" -- a mass protest in Cairo in August 2013 that was forcibly dispersed by security personnel -- and spreading \"false information\" to destabilize Egypt. They were arrested in a sweeping crackdown on supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, who was overthrown in 2013 in a military coup that bitterly split Egyptians. One of those sentenced to life in prison was Mohamad Soltan, a 27-year-old U.S.-Egyptian activist. He has been languishing in Cairo's notorious Tora Prison, where he has been on a hunger strike for more than 14 months. The U.S. State Department released a statement condemning Soltan's sentence and calling for his release on humanitarian grounds. The presiding judge for Badie, Soltan and the other defendants was Mohamed Nagy Shehata, who is known for his harsh verdicts. Shehata has sentenced more than 180 people to death and was the original judge in a high-profile case case involving Al Jazeera journalists. Badie had been sentenced to death before on a conviction related to a deadly attack on a police station. He has also been sentenced to life in prison for inciting violence during 2013's unrest. The Egyptian news outlet Al Ahram reported that Badie had been sentenced to death twice before, but an appeals court overturned one verdict, and Egypt's Grand Mufti disapproved of the other. During the summer of unrest, hundreds of people died when the police forcefully cleared camps set up by protesting Morsy supporters and when security forces opened fire on Morsy backers who attacked police stations, government buildings and churches. The government accused the protesters of inciting violence. After the coup, the new government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy was arrested, and he too faces trial. Soltan's sister, Hanaa, is anxious about what the future holds for her family. She wrote a letter to her brother expressing her feelings. \"Dear Mohamed,\" the letter read. \"I'm often asked why, and how, you've kept up your hunger strike for 14 months now, despite our pleas for you to end it. I've watched your body go from a plump basketball-playing frame to one that has withered down to its bones. \"Your face, with its beautiful smile often grinning, now looks permanently in pain. And, all I can do to explain is to tell people that it's the only form of control you have to hold on to -- now more than ever, on the eve of your sentencing.\" CNN's Don Melvin contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We're all guilty of it but there are some who do it more often than others. Experts say snacking is an important way to control hunger; and while we would like to think we reach for something healthy like carrot sticks, raisins or a handful of almonds, more often than not it's salty crisps, sweet biscuits or cheap chocolate that we tend to munch on. But why exactly do we snack? And if we knew what the triggers were, would we be able to stop ourselves from reaching for unhealthy foods? Scroll down for video . We're all guilty of snacking, but there are some who do it more often than others . Femail has worked with dietitian Lucy Jones from The Almond Board of California to study snacking habits in the UK and identified three tribes of snackers: Snack Amnesiacs, Situational Snackers and Super Snackers. Ms Jones's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly, identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes: . Ms Jones told Femail: 'Snack Amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack, opening something and eating far more than they intended. 'More often than not, these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating. According to Ms Jones, those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are Situational Snackers. This tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals. Then there are the Super Snackers. 'They are the snack savvy, who recognise energy lows and tummy grumbles and plan ahead. This tribe only nibble sensibly, as and when their body tells them to,' Ms Jones said. Ms Jones is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 Day Snack Happy challenge: a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days. 'Snacking is important to help control hunger and provide essential nutrients. We all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day, often resulting in long gaps between meals. 'The Snack Happy Challenge works well because 21 days is the length of time it takes to form a habit, or swap a bad habit for a good one. Planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day.' 'As a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients, almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about,' she said.

The Situational Snacker is a very busy bee and often doesn't have the time to prepare and eat a full meal during her day. To fill up, the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day, whilst she can. Nibbling on the children's packed lunch leftovers for breakfast whilst she chops up the carrots, snacking in the car for lunch after doing the food shop, or quickly scoffing half a sandwich before the company meeting is common for this type of snacker. If you're a 'Situational Snacker' you might find that emotional pressures, stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack, even if not hungry, and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of women in the UK said that stress lead them to overlook their nutrient intake. This is an issue I often see, and it can have a serious impact on health. If women aren't dedicating time to their diet and thinking carefully about their nutrient intake, they could be at risk of over or under eating. 'The key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk, in the kitchen, in the car, or wherever the hunger pangs strike. The nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals. Almonds are also a high source of magnesium, which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue, so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day.' If you are a Snack-Amnesiac: . Throughout her day, the Snack-Amnesiac will graze on the foods closest to hand, without even realising she's doing it. Munching through a share-size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful, reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action. Do you find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one, but suddenly the packet is empty? If you were asked to remember everything you'd nibbled on throughout the day, would you remember every mouthful? If you find yourself snacking on food without even realising, you could well be a Snack-Amnesiac and you're not alone – research commissioned by the Almond Board of California has shown that 90 per cent of women in the UK admit to snacking mindlessly throughout the day. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Research has shown that women are typically lacking in fibre and often eat higher levels of the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat. 'With 90 per cent of women suspected of suffering from Snack-Amnesia1 and eating anything close to hand without taking the nutrient content into account, it isn't difficult to see how diets become unbalanced. However, if you are a 'Snack Amnesiac,' there are easy ways you can ensure you're still achieving a balanced diet. Almonds are a high source of fibre and just a handful (approximately 30g or 23 almonds) a day can boost your nutrient intake. These great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat, and in fact, a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day. If Snack-Amnesiacs keep a handful of almonds close by, this could help to curb the cravings and the mindless munching later in the day. If you are a Super Snacker: . The Super Snacker is a woman who is well aware of her snacking habits and despite a busy day, or the odd sweet craving, she'll do what she can to stay strong and find the foods she needs to help get her through – no matter what the day might bring. Busy day of meetings and no time for lunch – the super snacker will ensure she's got a steady supply of her favourite nutritional snacks pre-packed and close to hand to see her through. Prone to an afternoon lull – the Super Snacker will have a nutritious pick-me up ready to go. Craving an evening treat after a long day – the Super Snacker will reach for a snack from the well-stocked healthy snack jar. Do you pack a snack in your handbag each day? Are you familiar with the times of day that you need an extra boost? If so, like one in five women in the UK, you could be a Super Snacker. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Well-balanced snacking is a great way to stay on top of your hunger pangs and ensure a daily dose of the nutrients that your body needs. But healthy and happy snacking needn't be difficult or dull. 'As most Super Snackers know, there are some simple tricks to help adopt happy snacking habits. Mixing up different textures and flavours adds variety to your daily food intake. 'Pack a punch with a nutritiously crunchy handful of almonds added to some mango for sweetness, or even dark chocolate for a more indulgent snack.'</td>\n",

       "      <td>Anthony Joshua believes his 'hunger and determination' will more than make up for Jason Gavern's superior experience when the pair go head to head in Newcastle on Saturday. Joshua will be entering the ring for the first time in 2015, after he was forced to pull out of a January fight against Kevin Johnson due to a stress fracture in his back. The London 2012 gold medallist is unbeaten in 10 professional bouts but yet to go past round three, while Gavern is walking into the ring for the 50th time in his career. Anthony Joshua poses at his weigh-in ahead of the fight with Jason Gavern at the Newcastle Metro Arena . 'At 11 fights he's probably looking at me like I'm a raw novice in the professional world,' Joshua told IFL TV. 'He's got 50 fights and he's looking at himself like he has so much experience but hunger and determination has got me through a lot of the time. 'I'm 10 fights in now - double figures. I can definitely say I'm learning and everything will be second nature on Saturday. 'I'll try not to let the nerves get to me. I'm going to stay calm. It's a mental thing. 'Sparring has been really good. I've been sparring with guys who are sharp and I've been handling business in sparring so I should be good to go on Saturday night.' Gavern's last fight in the UK came in November 2013, when he lost the Prizefighter final to Michael Sprott - an opponent Joshua took just 90 seconds to knock out in November. The British heavyweight is, however, taking nothing for granted this weekend. 'There's no sparring you can do to prepare for Gavern,' Joshua said. 'With 50 fights and so much experience, he's a very awkward opponent. 'I've watched his videos and he's awkward to hit. 'He's entertaining as well - he can get in your head mentally. 'I've been out five months so I'll probably have a bit of ring rust myself while he'll be sharp so there will be some heavyweight blows and may the best man win.' Joshua and Gavern strike a pose as they prepare for their fight on Saturday at the Newcastle Metro Arena . The two fighters pose for another photograph in front of the Tyne Bridge ahead of their match in Newcastle . Joshua lands a punch on his opponent Denis Bakhtov during their WBC International Heavyweight match . Gavern has not had long to prepare for Joshua as he was only confirmed on the card a week ago but the 37-year-old American has vowed to put on a show at the Metro Radio Arena. 'Boxing is about opportunities and I'm looking forward to this fight,' Gavern said. 'I saw the odds on Facebook of me getting knocked out within 15 seconds, or 20 seconds or 30 seconds - it's kind of funny. 'It's the heavyweight division, Anthony Joshua is here for a reason. He's a gold medallist for a reason and I've a lot of respect for him - it's going to be a lot of fun for the fans.' Gavern lands a punch on James Toney (left) during the International Heavyweight Prizefighter match in York . Gavern will be competing in his 50th professional bout while Joshua will be fighting only his 11th .</td>\n",
